Outline 
Part 1: Theory
Part 2: Implement the game (environment)
Part 3: Implement the agent
Part 4: Implement the model

Reinforcement Learning (RL)
RL is teaching a software agent how to behave in an environment by telling it how good it's doing.

Use of Deep Learning
or Deep Q Learning

Reward System
Action System - directions
State
    State means - we have to tell the snake some information about thr game that it knows about,
    so it need to know about the environment.

all the values are in boolean values?
